Inventory app ruby on rails api backend Portfolio Project

Inventory-Tracker

Introduction:

This is a personal tool for keeping track of the things you have and where you keep them. It uses the Rails framework as an api and JavaScript as the frontend. The application uses postgresql for the database to store items you'd like to track.

Running the app:

1. fork and clone this repo.

2. cd into inventory-backend-api

3. in the terminal, run bundle install to install all required gems

4. run the command "rails s" to start the app server

5. visit localhost:3000 to have the server running.

6. visit https://github.com/jreyes8631/inventory_frontend for additional instructons for the frontend.
